# Image Scraper

This project is a simple web application that allows users to download images based on a keyword. The user enters a keyword and the number of images they want, and the application scrapes the images from Google Images, then saves them to a folder on the user's desktop.

## Features

- **Keyword-based Image Search**: Enter any keyword, and the app will search Google Images for related images.
- **Customizable Image Count**: Specify the number of images you want to download.
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Images are saved in a folder on your desktop, named after the keyword you entered.
